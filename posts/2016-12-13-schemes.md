In keeping with the *long*-term goal of understanding the proofs of the Weil conjectures, I'm going to start talking about some basic algebraic geometry on this blog. Due to a lot of school-related work, my inability to keep away from taking up side projects at bad times, and college applications (*soft crying*), this has been delayed far too long. (Almost four months, as a matter of fact.)

So: this is the master post for what I'm calling my *schemes sequence*.[^lw] 

Note that I'm writing about this stuff *as* I learn about it, primarily to improve my own understanding of the material. Any corrections, however minor, will be accepted graciously (I'm not a native English speaker, so there's that, too!), as will comments from anyone who knows this stuff better than I do.

## Preamble

All through this series, our rings will be commutative and have \\(1\\). If that doesn't make sense, think about \\(\\Z\\) and you'll be fine (if you read around a lot).

I will try to assume very little algebraic or topological knowledge and will talk about the definitions of, e.g. ideals, as we go. I'll break the background up into separate posts, since I expect that a significant part of my audience is familiar with ring theory and modules.

## Posts

### Part 1: Ideals-as-points, and sheaves ([link](/schemes-i/))

After some motivation for schemes, this is the first part of the definition of affine schemes, in which I outline how prime ideals can sensibly be considered points of a space. I then define sheaves and talk about how I think of them.

### Part 2: The topology on an affine scheme

### Part 3: The structure sheaf of an affine scheme

## Background

### What is a prime ideal? ([link](/ideals-and-prime-ideals/))

Ring theory background for Part 1. Gentle introduction to ideals, prime ideals, and maximal ideals. Lots of examples. (Part 1 links to this at the appropriate point, go [read that](/schemes-i/) instead.)

[^lw]: I don't read LessWrong. This, of course, means nothing more or less than what it appears to mean; I've just found it harder and harder to find time to read over the last few years.
